# R2 Configuration for Signed URL Generation
# 
# The website uses the same R2 credentials as the Python build scripts.
# Credentials are stored in ~/.r2_credentials and sourced automatically
# by npm scripts (dev, build, preview).
#
# If you need to set up R2 credentials, create ~/.r2_credentials with:
#
# export R2_ENDPOINT="https://ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"
# export R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key_id"
# export R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_access_key"
# export R2_BUCKET="instrumetriq-datasets"
#
# Then run: source ~/.r2_credentials
# Or just use npm run dev (it sources automatically)
#
# No .env file needed - credentials are shared with Python scripts.
