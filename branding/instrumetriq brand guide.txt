# Instrumetriq — Brand Rules & Principles

## 1. Brand Purpose

**Instrumetriq measures market narratives.**
It does not predict, promise, or persuade.

The brand must communicate:

* rigor
* restraint
* credibility
* methodological honesty

Avoid anything that suggests:

* hype
* “alpha”
* excitement
* urgency

---

## 2. Brand Personality

**Primary traits**

* Analytical
* Calm
* Neutral
* Serious
* Unemotional

**Secondary traits**

* Methodical
* Precise
* Slightly austere

**Explicitly not**

* Playful
* Friendly
* Aggressive
* Trend-driven
* Sales-oriented

If a design choice feels “cool”, question it.

## 3. Logo Usage Rules

### Logo characteristics

* Wordmark only
* Monochrome
* Lowercase
* No decorative elements

### Allowed logo colors

* Off-white / light grey on dark backgrounds
* Black or very dark grey on light backgrounds

### Forbidden

* Gradients
* Shadows
* Outlines
* Color fills
* Partial coloring of letters
* Use of accent color inside the logo body

The logo is an **anchor**, not a focal effect.

---

## 4. Clear Space & Scale

* Clear space is defined by the vertical distance between:

  * top of the `i` dots
  * bottom of the `q` tail
* No other elements may enter this space

The logo must never feel crowded.

---

## 5. Color System

### Primary palette (environment)

**Dark background (default)**

* Very dark grey (not pure black)
* Used for:

  * website background
  * dashboards
  * hero sections

**Secondary dark**

* Slightly lighter dark grey
* Used for:

  * cards
  * panels
  * section separation

**Light foreground**

* Off-white / very light grey
* Used for:

  * primary text
  * logo on dark

Avoid pure white except in print/PDF contexts.

---

### Accent color (strictly limited)

**Desaturated cyan**

* Used sparingly
* Never decorative
* Never dominant

Allowed uses:

* active states
* hover states
* selected items
* key data points
* thin dividers
* indicators

If cyan is noticeable at first glance, it is overused.

---

## 6. Typography

### Primary typeface

* Sans-serif, geometric or neutral grotesk
* Consistent across:

  * website
  * documents
  * UI
  * marketing materials

### Typography behavior

* High hierarchy clarity
* Calm line spacing
* No playful weights
* No excessive variation

Typography should feel **measured**, not expressive.

---

## 7. Layout & Composition

* Grid-driven layouts
* Strong alignment
* Generous margins
* Minimal borders
* Prefer spacing over lines

Avoid:

* card overload
* visual noise
* unnecessary separators

Whitespace is part of the brand.

---

## 8. Language & Tone

### Language rules

* Declarative, not persuasive
* Observational, not promotional
* Evidence-first phrasing

Prefer:

* “measured”
* “observed”
* “documented”
* “no significant correlation”
* “negative result”

Avoid:

* “unlock”
* “powerful”
* “revolutionary”
* “AI-driven alpha”
* “guaranteed”

---

## 9. Data & Visualization

* Neutral colors
* Cyan only for emphasis
* No rainbow charts
* No aggressive contrast

Charts should feel like:

> research output
> not
> marketing visuals

---

## 10. Guiding Principle (Most Important)

> **If a design element does not improve clarity or credibility, remove it.**

Instrumetriq’s strength is **restraint**.

---

## 11. Long-Term Brand Intent

The brand should:

* age well
* survive redesigns
* integrate into larger organizations
* feel acquisition-ready without modification

The goal is not memorability through novelty, but through **trust**.
