This dataset captures **2-hour observation sessions** of cryptocurrency trading pairs on Binance. Each row represents one session where a coin was tracked for market conditions and social sentiment.

## Key characteristics

- **Flat schema** — 19 columns, no nested structs, ready for analysis
- **Essential metrics only** — price, spread, score, sentiment summary
- **X (Twitter) sentiment** — post counts and mean score
- **Daily granularity** — one parquet file per UTC day

## Use cases

- Quick sentiment screening across coins
- Correlation studies between price and social activity
- Lightweight backtesting inputs
- Learning/prototyping with minimal data complexity

## Field Reference (19 columns)

### Identity & Timing (6)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `symbol` | string | The cryptocurrency trading pair symbol in BASEQUOTE format (e.g., 'ALTUSDC' where ALT is the base asset and USDC is the quote currency). This is the exchange symbol used on Binance spot market. The symbol identifies which coin is being tracked in this watchlist session. Pattern: 3-15 uppercase alphanumeric characters. Source: Captured at session admission from the universe scanning loop in the main bot. |
| `snapshot_ts` | string | UTC timestamp of when this watchlist entry was first created/admitted. Format: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.sssZ' (ISO 8601 with Z suffix). This marks the start of the 2-hour tracking session. Source: Generated by datetime.now(timezone.utc) in core/watchlist_builder.py at the moment of entry construction. |
| `meta_added_ts` | string | UTC timestamp (ISO 8601) of when this session was admitted to the active watchlist. This is the official session start time. Format: 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssssssZ'. Source: Set by admit_session() in core/watchlist_v2_session.py at the moment of watchlist insertion. |
| `meta_expires_ts` | string | UTC timestamp (ISO 8601) when this session will expire. Calculated as added_ts + TTL (default 2 hours / 7200 seconds). After this time, the entry is archived and removed from active watchlist. Source: Computed as added_ts + WATCHLIST_TTL_HOURS in admit_session(). |
| `meta_duration_sec` | double | Total session duration in seconds from admission to archival. Calculated as (expired_ts - added_ts).total_seconds(). Typically ~7200 seconds (2 hours) but may vary slightly based on archiver timing. Source: Computed in _archive_entry() in core/watchlist_archiver.py. |
| `meta_archive_schema_version` | int64 | The schema version of the entry at the time of archival. Copied from schema_version to preserve the original schema even if migrations occur. Used for archive compatibility. Current production version is 7. Source: Set by _archive_entry() from meta.schema_version. |

### Spot Market (4)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `spot_mid` | double | Mid-price calculated as (bid + ask) / 2, in quote currency (USD for USDC pairs). This is the theoretical fair price at the moment of snapshot. Source: Computed from Binance spot API bookTicker endpoint bid/ask prices in build_spot_raw_v5(). |
| `spot_spread_bps` | double | Bid-ask spread expressed in basis points (1 bps = 0.01%). Formula: 10000 * (ask - bid) / mid. Lower values indicate tighter, more liquid markets. Example: 7.5 bps means the spread is 0.075% of the mid price. Source: Computed in build_spot_raw_v5() from bid/ask prices. |
| `spot_range_pct_24h` | double | 24-hour price range as a percentage of mid price. Formula: 100 * (high24 - low24) / mid. Measures intraday volatility - higher values indicate more price movement. Example: 5.46 means the 24h high-low range was 5.46% of current price. Source: Computed from Binance spot API ticker/24hr high/low prices. |
| `spot_ticker24_chg` | double | 24-hour price change as a signed percentage. Positive = price increased, negative = price decreased over last 24 hours. Example: -0.149 means price dropped 0.149% in 24h. Source: Binance spot API ticker/24hr endpoint 'priceChangePercent' field. |

### Derived Metrics (2)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `derived_liq_global_pct` | double | Global liquidity percentile rank across ALL trading pairs in the universe. Range: 0-100 percentile. Measures this coin's 24h quote volume relative to all other coins. Formula: percentile_rank(this_coin_qv, all_coins_qv) * 100. Higher = more liquid than peers. Example: 31.7 means this coin has more volume than ~32% of all coins. Source: Computed in base_scorer.py using bisect_right on sorted global volume baseline. |
| `derived_spread_bps` | double | Current bid-ask spread in basis points. Formula: ((ask - bid) / mid) * 10000. Example: 7.56 bps = 0.0756% spread. NOTE: This field is updated by the sampler every ~10 seconds during the 2-hour session, so the archived value reflects the LAST sample before expiry. Source: Computed in watchlist_sampler.py from live bid/ask prices. |

### Scoring (1)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `score_final` | double | Weighted composite score determining admission eligibility. Range: 0-100. Formula: sum(factor_score * factor_weight) + meta_contributions + pair_bonus, clamped to [0,100]. Weights loaded from weights.json (default: liq=0.15, mom=0.10, vol=0.10, str=0.05, spread=0.15, taker=0.15, flow=0.10, depth=0.10, microstruct=0.10). **INTERPRETATION:** >=60 typically passes admission threshold. 80+ = excellent candidate (strong on most factors). 40-60 = marginal (mixed signals). <40 = poor candidate. Source: base_scorer.py _compute_final_score_and_verdict(). |

### X (Twitter) Sentiment (6)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `sentiment_posts_total` | int64 | Total number of tweets collected and analyzed for this cryptocurrency during the most recent scraping cycle. A 'cycle' is one complete pass through all tracked coins in the scraper's round-robin schedule. The duration of a cycle varies based on API rate limits and queue size (typically ~49 minutes). Source: Sum of all tweets for this coin in the cycle. |
| `sentiment_posts_pos` | int64 | Count of tweets classified as POSITIVE sentiment using lexicon-based analysis. A tweet is positive if its sentiment score > 0.1 on a scale of -1.0 to +1.0. The lexicon matches terms from categories: positive_general (bullish, moon, hodl, gains, etc.) and pump_hype (pump, breakout, rally, etc.). Source: Computed by aggregation_utils.aggregate_sentiment_metrics(). |
| `sentiment_posts_neu` | int64 | Count of tweets classified as NEUTRAL sentiment using lexicon-based analysis. A tweet is neutral if its sentiment score is between -0.1 and +0.1 on a scale of -1.0 to +1.0. These tweets contain no strong positive or negative sentiment signals. Source: Computed by aggregation_utils.aggregate_sentiment_metrics(). |
| `sentiment_posts_neg` | int64 | Count of tweets classified as NEGATIVE sentiment using lexicon-based analysis. A tweet is negative if its sentiment score < -0.1 on a scale of -1.0 to +1.0. The lexicon matches terms from categories: negative_general (bearish, crash, dump, etc.), fud_fear (fud, scam, rugpull, etc.), and scam_rug. Source: Computed by aggregation_utils.aggregate_sentiment_metrics(). |
| `sentiment_mean_score` | double | Mean of hybrid_score_3class values across all tweets. Each tweet gets -1.0 (negative), 0.0 (neutral), or +1.0 (positive) from the hybrid two-model AI system. Range: -1.0 to +1.0. Positive values indicate overall positive sentiment, negative values indicate overall negative. Example: 0.67 means sentiment skews positive. The hybrid system uses a primary DistilBERT model for prediction and a referee model for confidence calibration and overrides. Source: statistics.mean(hybrid_score_3class values). |
| `sentiment_is_silent` | bool | True if zero tweets were collected for this coin during this scraping cycle. A silent coin may indicate low market interest or search query issues. Source: Determined by build_cycle_bucket() when posts_total == 0. |

## Notes

- Tier 1 is intended for research and analysis. It is not real-time data and is not presented as a trading signal.
- When `sentiment_is_silent` is true, sentiment fields can be NULL.
