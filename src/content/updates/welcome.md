description: "Introducing Instrumetriq - a new sentiment data collection project"
---

Instrumetriq is a research project focused on measuring narrative signals from public X (Twitter) posts.

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives include:

- Collect public X (Twitter) posts for a defined set of assets
- Score each post with a domain-specific sentiment model
- Aggregate activity and silence into fixed time windows (cycles)
- Compare aggregated signals with external market factors (analysis tooling is not published yet)

## Current Status

Collection and storage are X (Twitter)-only.

Per-post sentiment scores are computed at ingestion time, and cycle-level summaries are produced for monitoring.

## Stay Tuned

Updates in this section will log changes to collection, scoring, and aggregation.

Check the Status page for the latest published collection snapshot.
