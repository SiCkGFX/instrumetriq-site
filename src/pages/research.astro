      <h2>Data Collection Approach</h2>
      <p>
        Collection follows platform rules and basic research hygiene:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compliance with X (Twitter) Terms of Service and operational limits</li>
        <li>Minimize retained personal data; keep records focused on content and timestamps</li>
        <li>Document query construction and aggregation semantics</li>
        <li>Deduplicate posts to avoid double-counting across searches</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scoring Framework</h2>
      <p>
        Public posts from {PLATFORM} are scored using the {SCORING}.
        Scores are rolled up into {AGGREGATION} summaries, including explicit handling of silence.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ethics & Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Instrumetriq is observational. It does not predict outcomes or claim causation.
        We aim to keep collection and storage conservative, and publish only claims that are supported by documented pipeline behavior.
